            land supply, in particular for residential use, has been an acute problem when a land area in the city has been
            identified as having potential for development but was undeveloped, leading the land area to be considered as
            under-utilised and vacant. These vacant, under-utilised and undeveloped lands are subject to various land supply
            constraints. Past research has identified several indicators that can enhance land efficiency, namely a safe,
            attractive, and healthy environment that can at the same time offer educational opportunities, employment,
            entertainment and social attraction. Additionally, other indicators include physical ownership marketability,
            infrastructure, land use, financial deficit and pollution. All indicators were found to influence urban land
            efficiency in the context of providing housing to the city residents. Therefore, the institutional economics
            analysis is usually carried out in a descriptive way. The broad nature of formal and informal institutions, rules
            and constraints leads to a descriptive identification of formal and informal institutions, agency relations and
            agents’ decisions which constrain the supply of land for development. In particular, the analytical tool of
            institutional economics analysis framework was utilised to investigate the existence, importance and implications
            of land supply constraints on the land development process."""
