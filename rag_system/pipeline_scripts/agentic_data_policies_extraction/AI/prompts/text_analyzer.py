    I will provide you a scientific paper and i want you to extract the conclusion section.
    I want the exact conclusion, **word for word**, without any rewording or summarizing.

    The conclusion section is close to the end of scientific papers, and is explicitely indicated like "5. Conclusions" or "Conclusion".
    If there is no conclusion section of if the conclusion is mixed with the discussion, extract the results section, indicated like '3. Results'.

    Define the following key variables for the extraction process:

    1. **GEOGRAPHIC**: The **GEOGRAPHIC** refers to the **geographical scope** or **area of study** under study.
    - If the conclusion mentions a specific region, **country**, or **city** such as **deprived neighbourhoods**, specific **countries**, or **cities**, specify this.
    - If no geographical scope is mentioned, label it as "None".

    2. **ITEM**: The specific practice, choice, lifestyle, public policy, private action, property, feature, technological device, system, or service mentioned in the conclusion.
    **ITEM** cannot be a metric, measure, methods, or model. It refers to concrete actions, policies, features, or devices described in the text.
    It should include the sense of variation of the **ITEM** (**increasing**, **lower**, **diminish**, etc.).
    The **ITEM** should be complete and as detailed as possible, extracting all relevant aspects from the conclusion (for instance, if the conclusion analyses the "European regulation" **ITEM** must report on what it applies (example: transport safety), if etc.).

    **Examples of ITEM**:
    - **Practices, choices, behaviors, and lifestyles**: biking, carpooling, car-free lifestyle, teleworking.
    - **Public policies or private actions**: carbon tax, transit infrastructure investment, reduced traffic zoning, corporate mobility plan, car weight reduction.
    - **Properties and features of the built environment and cities**: sidewalks width, bike lanes investment, urban density, walkability, infrastructure.
    - **Spatial distribution of urban amenities and location mismatches**: spatial mismatch, job accessibility, home-work separation, urban growth, sprawling development, residential specialization.
    - **Technical or technological devices, systems, and services**: electric scooter sharing, bus rapid transit, microcars, trolleybus, tram systems.

    3. **FACTOR**: The **FACTOR** refers to the specific outcome or characteristic that the **ITEM** impacts or influences. This could be a variable, metric, or property, such as CO2 emissions, energy use, health outcomes, traffic congestion, car dependency, food or job accessibility, income inequalities, or land use.
    - **FACTOR** cannot include negative formulations like "decrease", "reduction", "lowering", "savings", or "loss of". If the **FACTOR** is presented negatively in the conclusion, it should be rephrased positively (e.g., "CO2 emission reduction" should be framed as "CO2 emissions", the reduction part would be included in the **CORRELATION**).
    - **FACTOR** can also be an **ITEM** in the context of other **ITEMs**. In other words, an **ITEM** can act as a **FACTOR** for another **ITEM** if it influences or affects it. For example, **public transport** (an **ITEM**) can affect **CO2 emissions** (a **FACTOR**), but **CO2 emissions** can also be impacted by another **ITEM** like **carpooling**. Therefore, when extracting **ITEMs** and **FACTORS**, be aware that **ITEMs** can also act as **FACTORS** for other **ITEMs**.

    4. **CORRELATION**: The **CORRELATION** describes the nature of the relationship between the **ITEM** and the **FACTOR**:
    - If the **ITEM** is **increasing** or **raising** the **FACTOR**, label it as "increasing".
    - If the **ITEM** is **reducing**, **diminishing**, or **lowering** the **FACTOR**, label it as "decreasing".
    - If the **ITEM** has a **neutral impact** on the **FACTOR**, label it as "neutral".
    - If the **ITEM** has an **unspecified** effect, label it as "None".

    5. **POPULATION**: The **POPULATION** refers to the specific **socio-demographic group** affected by the **FACTOR**.
    - If the conclusion mentions a specific socio-demographic group, such as people in **elderly**, **young**, **low-income households**, **first decile**, **suburban households**, **peripheral**, etc., specify this.
    - If no socio-demographic group is mentioned, label it as "None".

    6. **MODE**: The **MODE** refers to the specific modes of transportation related to the **ITEM** and mentioned in the conclusion.
    - If the conclusion mentions transportation modes, such as **bus**, **car**, **bike**, **bike-sharing**, **public transport**, **electric scooter**, **automobile**, etc., please specify it.
    - If no **mode of transport** is **clearly** mentioned, leave it as "None".

    7. **ACTOR**: The **ACTOR** refers to the institution or person directly effecting the **ITEM** and mentioned in the conclusion.
    - If the conclusion mentions, such as **government**, **local authority**, **car manufacturer**, **firm**, **individual** etc., please specify it.
    - If no actor is **clearly** mentioned, leave it as "None".

    ---

    Now, analyze the following conclusion and:
    1. Identify the **GEOGRAPHIC** scope of the study (if mentioned in the conclusion). If not, label it as "None".
    2. Extract all the **ITEMs** mentioned. If **no ITEMs** are found in the conclusion, return **None** and stop the prompt.
    3. For each extracted **ITEM**, determine whether it has a **increasing**, **decreasing**, or **neutral** effect on one or more **FACTORS**. Extract the impacted **FACTORS** (write "None" if no factors are impacted).
    4. For each **ITEM** and its associated **FACTOR**, specify the **CORRELATION** as stated in the conclusion.
    5. If the **FACTOR** applies to a specific **POPULATION**, specify it as **POPULATION**.
    6. If the **ITEM** is related to a specific **MODE** of transportation, specify it.
    7. If the **ITEM** is related to a specific **ACTOR**, specify it.

    **Do not make any assumptions or infer data for items that are not mentioned in the conclusion.**
    **Do not use acronyms if the developed formulation is in the conclusion.**

    Return the extracted information in the following JSON format:

    **The above labels are only examples of the data format. Do **not** include them in your response. The extracted data should use the actual **ITEM** and **FACTOR** names as they appear in the conclusion.**

    The output should **not** start with the word "json" or "```json", and do **not** include any other labels outside of the JSON format.
